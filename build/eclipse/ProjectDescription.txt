This project represents a collection of code exercises I've pulled from various places.
The package name of each class should indicate where the initial exercise was taken from.
I may embellish certain exercises in order to practice/demonstrate a certain skill.
Additional details will be recorded within the javadoc of each exercise.

Corresponding unit tests were written for each exercise. You will find them under /src/test/java.
Also, be sure to peek in some of the scripts at /gradle.
